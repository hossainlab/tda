# Transcriptomics Data Analysis (TDA)

## Course Overview
Transcriptomics Data Analysis (TDA) is a live, instructor-led training program designed to introduce participants to best practices in the analysis of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. This course empowers learners to independently analyze gene expression datasets using lightweight, open-source tools — with a strong emphasis on the R programming language and the Bioconductor ecosystem.

Delivered over live Zoom sessions, the course blends concise theoretical discussions with interactive, hands-on coding exercises using real-world ‘omic datasets. The instructional approach encourages active learning and immediate application of concepts.

While the primary focus is on infectious disease, immunology, and One Health research, the analytical frameworks and data interpretation skills taught are broadly applicable to diverse areas of genomics and transcriptomics research.
